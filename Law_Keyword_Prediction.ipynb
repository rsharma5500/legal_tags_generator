       " 'therefore the annual rent actually received by the landlord in the absence of any special circumstance would be good guide to decide the rent which the landlord might reasonably expect to receive from hypothetical tenant since the premise in the present case are not controlled by any rent control legislation the annual rent received by the landlord is what willing lessee uninfluenced by other circumstance would pay to willing lessor hence actual annual rent in these circumstance can be taken a the annual rate able value of the property for the assessment of property tax the municipal corporation is therefore entitled to revise the rate able value of the propriety which have been freed from rent control on the basis of annual rent actually received unless the owner satisfies the municipal corporation that there are other consideration which have affected the quantum of rent ',\n",
